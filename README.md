# Sensor-based Data Logging Using Microcontrollers

There are several ways to save data from a sensor attached to a microcontroller.  If you're connected to a personal computer, you can simply send the data from the controller to the personal computer serially, and save it to a file.  If you've got an SD card attached to the microcontroller, you can save the data to the SD card. Or, if you have access to the internet and a device that can connect to a server, you can save the data to a server. 

This site contains a number of data logging examples I've written for different workshops on the topic over the years. The most recent examples reflect my most up-to-date practices, of course.
